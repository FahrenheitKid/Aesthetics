if you somehow get stuck in the menu, make sure you are moving only horizontaly (moving between menu options are never vertical)
and are confirming the options you select.

Also, during character selection, you can only go past that screen once everyone is ready, and can only come back if
everyone is at the first option (character select).

You can only move with the control style you selected. (The change in the style only applies after the character selection screen)

How to Play:
Basics
The objective of the game is to have the highest score. You can achieve this by painting the tiles of the map as you move.

To move your character or use Items, you need to press the respective button at the moment of the beat. You can't move or use items off beat. There are guide lines (cursors actually) at the bottom of the screen that helps to get the tempo of the beat too. It's pretty much a rip-off of the Crypt of The Necrodancer Movement System

To score, you need to get the ScoreMaker Item (that is a blue and purple colored Cube).  You earn points equivalent to the number of tiles of your color at the moment you catch the item. When you score, all your painted tiles get erased, going white again.

This value can be multiplied by your multiplier (that can go higher as your combo increases). To maintain combo you cannot miss a movement.

The tiles in the game may show some counters on them. When the countdown reaches zero, the tile can either go up or disappear, making your character get stunned or fall in the hole, respectively.

The music Pleasure by Vapordizzle is the easiest one because the stage dont change itself. I recommend starting with this song.

Items
Passive items are the ones which becomes active on their own.

Active Items are the ones which you need to press your Action button to use/activate it.

Instant items are the ones which its effects happen in an instant and have no duration time.

Lasting Items are the ones which its effects have a duration time.

{Lock} (Passive, Lasting): It is a padlock that when collected makes all tiles of the player in question immune to opponents, ie can not be painted by any other player.
{Arrow} (Passive, Instant): It is an arrow pointing to one of the four directions. It can rotate from time to time, changing its direction. When collected, all tiles in the indicated direction are painted with the color of the player in question. There are three variations of this item: One that points only in one direction (north, south, east or west); points to two opposing directions (north-south, east-west); points to all 4 directions.
{V Ray} (Active, Instant): A ray in vertical orientation that when activated projects two rays lasers that leave from the player and reach all the column that he is at the moment. Opponents hit by lightning bolts are stunned for a period of time.
{H Ray} (Active, Instant): It works just like {V Ray} but the rays are thrown horizontally.
{Revolver} (Active, Instant): A pistol that when activated, the
player enters a "lock on" mode, where the next direction he presses on the controls will be the direction the shot will be cast. After entering the "target" mode, the player can shoot as soon as he or she wishes, right after, or wait for some time until some target approaches. The shot hits the first opponent in his path, stunning him and stealing that player's tiles, converting their color to the color of the player who shot. As with all other items, all inputs can't be offbeat.
{Rainbow Lipstick} (Passive, Lasting): A colorful lipstick that when being
collected makes the player's colors become the colors of their opponents. But they change only as a disguise, still counting to the user score. With tiles disguised, opponents will not be sure which ones actually belong to them and may avoid painting over the tiles of the item user.
{FastFoward} (Passive, Lasting): It looks like a
{FastFoward} icon characteristic of audio devices. When collected it accelerates the rhythm of the music for a certain period.
{SloMo} (Passive, Lasting): It acts in the same way as {FastFoward} but slows down the melody.
{Sneakers} (Passive, Lasting): A pair of shoes that allows the
player move two tiles per move instead of one. He paints all the tiles that pass during his movements.
{Floppy Disk} (Passive, Lasting): A small floppy disk that works
as a shield for the player. Once any negative effect affects the player, the diskette is automatically used and discarded, granting immunity for a short period of time.
{Compact Disk} (Active, Lasting): A CD that acts similarly to
{Floppy Disk}, but it is an Active item. When triggered grants the player immunity for a period equivalent to six times the value of his {Multiplier}.
{3D Glasses} (Passive, Instant): A goggles that at the moment that is caught causes the camera to rotate 90 degrees, changing the perspective of the game, and also increasing the {Multiplier} of the player in 3.


Controls: The game gives preference to controllers, so if any is plugged, it is going to set them as default, and any remaining players without controllers with keyboard. Only the Player 1 can navigate the menu (except for the charcter selection screen)


The game supports any number of Xbox and only one PS4 (or any generic) controllers. But only one PS4 controller is allowed.

Using DS4Windows or other programs to make PS4 controllers to behave like Xbox ones will result in bugs, unfortunately.
